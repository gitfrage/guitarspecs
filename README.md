*influence ( "-" stands for little,  "++++"  stands for very strong)

For example, for building a solid-body 'jazz-sounding' guitar you have to choose (top down by importance): 

 - vintage or jazz pickup with convenient po­ten­tiomet­er and capacitor values
 - flatwound strings
 - massive neck, hollow body with wood such as mahagony 
 - shorter scale length

### Scale Length

A guitar's scale length is calculated by measuring the distance from the front edge of the nut to the center of the 12th fret. 

 - 572 mm (22.5") or shorter - 3/4 & some travel guitars
 - 596,9 mm (23.50") - Fender Jazzmaster/Jaguar guitars
 - 629 mm (24.75") - many Gibson guitars
 - 635 mm (25") - many PRS guitars
 - 648 mm (25.5") - many Fender guitars
 - 650 mm (25.5)	- typical classical guitars
 - 686 mm (27") or longer - Baritone guitars

> [Wikipedia listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_length_%28string_instruments%29#Single_Scale) -  many other examples sorted by scale length

Scale has a relatively low impact on sound and playability of the guitar. (Compared with other parameters such as strings or pickups).

 Longer scale length sound and playability characteristics:
 - quick response, crisp attack
 - transparent sound with well-defined basses and heights
 - larger finger spread
 - higher string tension at constant gauge
 
Shorter scale length sound characteristics:
 - warmer
 - more sustain and longer decay

### Woods

¹ Sound:  the diagram for effects on tone stands mainly for acoustic instruments and NOT for solid body guitars, where other components have much larger impact on sound. Thus, a mahogany electric guitar can sound bright despite the representations below.   
² Weight may vary for the same variety.  
³ Used for: T - Body Top | B - Body | N - neck | F - fretboards

## Guitar Necks

Neck thickness, neck width, neck contour and fret wire size affect playability and are a matter of personal taste. Important for good playability is balanced interaction of these components. Thicker neck often creates warmer tone.

### Neck Nut Width 

Category    			       | Width 		        | Min e1/E6* | Max e1/E6*
-------------------------------|------------------  | ---------- | --------------
Many Fender guitars from Japan | 41 mm (1-5/8")     |
Standard    				   | 42.9 mm (1-11/16") | 
Acoustic like    			   | 44.5 mm (1-3/4")   | 34.7 mm    | 38 mm
Superwide   			       | 48 mm (1-7/8")     | 

*see  following chapter "String Nut Slot Spacing"

### Nut Slot Spacing 

The real  e1 to E6 string space can be controlled not only through nut width, but also by slot spacing in the nut.  For example, 44.5 mm wide nut can have e1 to E6 distance between 34.7 and  38 mm.

### Neck Heel Width and Mounting 

Most guitart parts manufacturer adopted Fender's® neck heel and neck pocket dimensions:

 - 56 mm (2-3/16") - Width
 - 76 mm (3") - Length
 - 16 mm (5/8") - Pocket Depth

These dimensions are not a standard. Only careful measurement ensures that your parts will be compatible.

Strat necks have a rounded base to their heel and Tele necks have a squared-off base to their heel, which makes it difficult to interchange the two types of necks across various bodies.

Standard Fender heel mounting is done with 4-Bolt Holes - 1/8" (3mm) diameter (spread of 2" x 1-1/2").


### Fretboard's Radius

Smaller radius means a more rounded shape.

 - 7-1/4"  - "Vintage" Fender®
 - 9-1/2" - "Modern" Fender®
 - 10" - Gibson®/PRS®
 - 12" - Ibanez®
 - 16" - Jackson®
 - compound (10" - 16") - Warmoth® and others 

> [Understring Radius Gauges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yiBbIzGjW8) - video  demo of three different gauges used for guitar setup and fretwork: standard, notched and understring.


###  Neck Back Contours

Neck Profile is the combination of contour (C,  U, V , asymmetrc) and thickness (.0750" - 1") 

Profiles*    | Thickness | Contours
-------------|--------   | ------------ 
Wizard		 | thinn	 | C
Standard	 | medium	 | C
Clapton		 | medium  	 | V 
Wolfgang	 | medium	 | asymmetrical
Boatneck	 | thick	 | V
Fatback		 | thick  	 | U/C
  
> *see  [Warmoth](http://www.warmoth.com/Guitar/Necks/BackContours.aspx) as source of these profile names. 


### Fret Sizes

Title        | Width   | Height    | Example
-------------|---------|-----------| -----------
Small		 | narrow  | low       | Vintage Fender
Me­di­um	     | narrow  | high      | many Martins
Medium Jumbo | wide    | low       | many Gibsons
Jum­bo	 	 | wide	   | high      | Moderne Fender
High Jum­bo	 | wide	   | very high | many Ibanez
	

> [lutherie.net](http://www.lutherie.net/fret.chart.html) provides an excellent manufacturer / sizes overview.

### Some Neck Shapes

 - 6L  - Fender Style - left in line
 - 6R - for left-handed
 - 3L/3R  - "Gobson Stype" 
 - 4L/2R  - "Musicman Style" 
 
### Tuner Holes

 - approx. 8,7mm (11/32") - "Vintage Fender Style" 
 - approx. 10mm (25/64" = 9,9mm)  - "Sperzel Style", 
 - approx. 10mm  (13/32" = 10,3mm) - "Planet Waves Style"
 - approx. 10mm on top and 8,7mm bottom -  "Schaller/Grover/Gotoh Slyle"
 
> [Sunk](http://www.rockinger.com/index.php?cat=WG181&product=09211-09213-09214) - the small holes can be enlarged with a sunk.  
> [Adapter bushings](http://www.musik-produktiv.de/goeldo-adapter-huelsen-fuer-mechaniken.html) -  used for retrofit to big holes.

----------

## Guitar Bodies

The sound of electric guitar depends mainly on the vibration behavior of the string itself and the reproduction characteristics of the pickup. The vibration behavior of the string depends (very little) on wood. The body itself is very thick compared to the neck, that is why the body wood type and form have very limited influence on the sound of electric guitar.

## Hardware

### Tuning Machines

Tuning Machines Options:

 - Diameters of bore holes for axis (see chapter [Tuner Holes](#tuner-holes))
 - Ratio - for 1x winding around the shaft head - 1x rotation necessary. 
   Larger ratio (1:18 > 1:14) allows finer adjustments.
 - Standard vs Locking  - with locking tuners strings are inserted through the axle bore and fixed by a screw from the outside
 
> [Schaller](http://guitar-parts.biz/hp290537/Machine-Heads.htm)  - useful information and technical drawing of guitar machine heads

### Bridges

Guitar bridge has large **influence on playability** (mainly through string spacing).  Wider string spacing is better for finger-picking style, narrow spacing gives easier control when playing leads with distorted tone.  [Bridge Routing](#bridge-routing) chapter above describes common bridge categories with string spacing specification.

Bridge form and material have also some **influence on sound**.
Good manufacturers provide detailed product information on their pages:
 
>  [ABM](http://www.abm-guitarpartsshop.com/From-a-Block-to-a-Bridge:_:206.html) -  indicates that Bell Brass and Steel shape the guitar sound with character, while Aluminum acts largely neutral in the transfer of tone.  
> [Schaller](http://guitar-bridge.com/hp12603/Guitar.htm) - All available Schaller guitar bridges, tailpieces, finetuning tailpieces and bridge-tailpiece combinations. (Plus Technical drawings).  
>  [TonePros](http://www.tonepros.com/bridge-and-tailpiece-sets/)  - bridge and tailpiece sets.

### Knob Styles

There are 3 common styles of knobs: 

 - bell
 - speed
 - domed

> [Philadelphia Luthier Tools Blog](http://blog.philadelphialuthiertools.com/2013/05/16/choosing-the-correct-knob-for-your-guitar-or-bass/)  - Choosing the correct knob for your guitar or bass.

### More Parts To Complete

 - Jacks & jackplates
 - Neck plate (neck-to-body)
 - Pickguard or pickup mounting rings, control plate for tele)
 - Screws for all parts above
 - String Ferrules (if you use "string through body"  instead of bridge)
 - String Retainers
 - Strap Holders
 
### Strings

Depending on following options your sound will be more bright or more mellow:

 - Construction (Flat Wound/Round Wound)
 - Material (Steel/Nickel) and
 - Tension 

Most manufacturers use following naming convention to describe tension of string set:

Name   	  | 'e' site approx. | 'E' site approx.      
------------|--------------- | --------
Extra-Light |  .008    		 | .039 
Light 		|  .009    		 | .042
Regular     |  .010    		 | .046 
Medium 		|  .011    		 | .052
Jazz        |  .012    		 | .054 
Baritone 	|  .013    		 | .056

There are also other hybrid sets available - like "Light Top/Heavy Bottom" and "Balanced Tension" combinations.

## Electronics

Electronics exerts greatest influence on the overall sound of a solid-body electric guitar.

> [The Secrets of Electric Guitar Pickups](http://www.buildyourguitar.com/resources/lemme/index.htm) - "If you know the resonant frequency and height of the resonant peak, you know about 90 percent of a pickup's transfer characteristics. Some other effects cannot be described using this model, but their influence is less important".

Frequency response of a magnetic pickup may looklike this ![resonant peak and frequency](https://github.com/gitfrage/guitarspecs/blob/master/images/resonant_peak_and_frequency.jpg)

Sound group | Resonant frequency |  Resonant peak | Example Pickup 
------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------
bright      | 3 - 6kHz     | high peak | Fender single coils
powerful    | 2 - 3kHz     | medium high peak | Gibson PAF
mellow      | 1.5 - 2kHz   | low peak | Rolling back tone pot

Following topics change resonant frequency and resonant peak:

 - [Pickup Properties](#pickup-properties)  - position and height of frequency peak vary from type to type.
 - [Electronics Wiring Options](#electronics-wiring-options)  - Hambucker coils are switched in series by default, switching them in parallel or using only one of the coils will increase resonant frequency and the sound will have more treble.
 - [Potentiometer and Capacitor Values](#potentiometer-and-capacitor-values) changing provides also simple way to change resonant frequency and peak.
 - Cable capacitance - longer cable will lead to lower resonant frequency.
 - Amp input impedance

### Pickup Properties

- Dimension and product group - see chapter  [Puckup Routing](#pickup-routing)
- Output: low(vintage), medium, high (vintage used often for jazz and blues)
- Wiring:  1, 2, 3  or 4-Con­ductor (4-Con­ductor allowing most flexible wiring)*
- Position: Bridge, Neck, Midd­le 
- Passive vs. Active (Active often used for distortion sound)
- D.C. Resistance: indication how much output a pickup will have
- E.Q. chat: A general idea as to the Bass, Mids and Treble.

### Active Pickups Electronics

Active Electronics tries to reduce dependancy from the shielded cable and amp input impedance. However, that needs power to operate, and that's its biggest drawback.

> [Custom Buffers (german)](http://www.guitar-letter.de/Angebot/BufferUndAmps/Impedanzwandler.htm) -  used  to decouple the guitar electronics from the sound influencing effects on the shielded cable.    
> [Seymour Duncan BMP-1Standard Blackout Modular Preamp](http://www.seymourduncan.com/accessory/blackouts-preamp-short-shaft) - make any pickup active.  
> [EMG PA2 Preamp/Booster](http://www.emgpickups.com/pa2.html)  -   mini-switch with 0-20dB boost.
